# Face Detection Attendance System

## Overview

The Face Detection Attendance System is a project designed to automate the attendance process using face recognition technology. This system captures images of individuals, detects their faces, and marks their attendance based on pre-enrolled face data. It aims to streamline the attendance process, reduce errors, and save time.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes advanced face detection algorithms to identify and track individuals.
- **Face Recognition:** Matches detected faces with pre-enrolled faces to mark attendance accurately.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Processes and records attendance in real time.
- **Data Storage:** Saves attendance records with timestamps for later review.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Face Detection Library:** OpenCV, Dlib
- **Face Recognition Library:** Face_recognition
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL (Specify the database used)
- **Web Framework:** Flask/Django (Specify the framework used)
- **Hardware Requirements:** Webcam, Computer with sufficient processing power

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- A webcam for capturing images

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-attendance-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd face-detection-attendance-system
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**

   Configure the database settings in `config.py` (if applicable), and initialize the database schema:

   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   Start the face detection and attendance application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will launch, and you should be able to access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port).

## Usage

1. **Enroll Faces**

   - Navigate to the "Enroll" section in the user interface.
   - Capture and save face images of individuals who need to be enrolled.

2. **Mark Attendance**

   - The system will automatically start capturing images from the webcam and detect faces.
   - Attendance will be marked based on the detected faces and matched with enrolled faces.

3. **View Attendance Records**

   - Access the "Records" section to view and export attendance logs.

## Configuration

Modify the configuration settings in `config.py` to adjust parameters such as database connection details, face detection thresholds, and logging options.

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera Issues:** Ensure the webcam is properly connected and functioning.
- **Face Detection Errors:** Check lighting conditions and adjust the detection threshold in `config.py`.
- **Database Connection Problems:** Verify database settings and ensure the database server is running.
